		<p>In 1781, a self-made chemist and scientist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and Torbern Bergman, a Swedish chemist and mineralogist, suggested it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing tungstic acid. Two years later, in 1783, Jose and Fausto Elhuyar were the first to isolate tungsten through the reduction of this acid with charcoal [7]. Today, tungsten is primarily obtained from wolframite and scheelite using the same basic method developed by Jos√© and Elhuyar [8].
	Tungsten has played an essential role throughout history. One notable example of this is serving as somewhat of a catalyst for political tensions during WW2. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira [2]. Tungsten's impressive properties were highly sought after by both axis and allied forces, cheifly for the production of armour piercing anti-tank rounds and other munitions.
	The first tungsten light bulbs were patented in 1904, and rapidly replaced the less efficient carbon filament lamps on the lighting market [1]; from this point onward, tungsten filament light bulbs would serve as the most popular form of artificial lighting worldwide. Incandescent lighting has only just started becoming obsolete with the invention of 'environmentally friendly' halogen and LED alternatives.

		<p>Even in its purest form Tungsten is a very robust material that can maintain its integrity despite a variety of different forces and exertions. Young's modulus is a measurement of the stiffness of a material; measured in Pascals (Pa). The young's modulus of Tungsten is around 411,000,000 Pa or 411 GPa making it more than twice as stiff as steel. Compounding the stiffness of Tungsten is its hardness which is down to strong bonds between the atoms. To cut or indent Tungsten would require a very large amount of force. 
	Tungsten's weakness culminate in its brittleness. Despite its hardness and stiffness there is a distinct lack of toughness in Tungsten. Crack propagation will occur if a large force is applied to a small area of the material.
